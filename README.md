## About
In this data analysis project, I have explored the covid-19 dataset and used Tableau to create my visualizations to find out the covid-19 numbers by country. 

## Findings
* Countries with high focus on individualism had more Covid cases e.g. U.S.
* Countries which were more authoritarian and group think was able to better manage the population & mitigate the spread of covid e.g SG
* Derived cross cultural differences in population attitude towards the pandemic 
*	However, need to account for and discount the lack of testing from EM countries

## Data Set
The covid-19 data set contains 950671 cases with 18 variables including case type, date, country_region, lat, long and others.
